PHP-Contact-Form
================

A Basic PHP contact form and script<br />
This is a simple contact form, where a user can inquire about the services on a website and give a little information about him/herself. Also noteworthy is that it contains all the major form types: text, textarea, select, radio, checkbox, and submit.

Each form element has a name attribute and a value attribute, except for textarea, which has an ending tag instead of a value attribute. Furthermore, radio buttons all have the same name to ensure only one is checked, while checkboxes have different names so that any of them can be checked. select tags contain their names and values within separate option tags, for that nice drop-down-menu effect.
